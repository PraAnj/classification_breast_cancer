# Sample implementations of basic classification algorithms

This repo contains sample implementation of widely used classification models. Famous WinconsinData breast cancer dataset is used for all the classification model tested. Discussions about each of the classification model included in each notebook. You can find following models in src folder,

1. Naive Bayes
2. Decision tree (C4.5 - https://github.com/michaeldorner/DecisionTrees)
3. Logistic regression.
4. Random forest
5. KNN (Nearest neighbour)
6. LVQ classifier (https://pypi.org/project/sklearn-lvq/)
