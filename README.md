# Sample usage of basic classification algorithms

This repo contains sample usage of widely used classification models. Famous WinconsinData breast cancer dataset is used to test all the classification models for ease of comparison. Discussions about each of the classification model were included at the end of each notebook. You can find following models in src folder,

1. Naive Bayes
2. Decision tree (C4.5 - https://github.com/michaeldorner/DecisionTrees)
3. Logistic regression.
4. Random forest
5. KNN (Nearest neighbour)
6. LVQ classifier (https://pypi.org/project/sklearn-lvq/)

Plan to implement following models/ boosting methods in the future,

1. Support Vector classifier (svm.SVC)
2. Extra Trees
3. Multiple layer perceprton (neural network)
4. Linear Discriminant Analysis
5. AdaBoost
6. Gradient Boosting
7. XGBoost/ CatBoost/ LightGBM
